It's about seven years ago I worked at a helpdesk. At that time, I created a document to register what people say (in Dutch). Don't get me wrong; people are not stupid. They are just end users. Being an end user doesn't make their stupid less stupid. They just don't know the ways of the internetz. That's not important. What's important is the supid shit they say. Please do check the stupid shit they say.
